# (c) 2009, Bjoern Rennhak, The University of Tokyo
# CheckSpec.rb reads the ../specification/XYAMLSpecification.yaml file and provides a CLI interface to
# either output the specific problem or only a binary switch if the spec is ok (TRUE, 1) or not ok
# (FALSE, 0).
#
# This tool is normally used by developers who extend the XYAMLSpecification.yaml file not by
# end-users.
#
#########


# = Standard requires will get executed in the Object creation program flow.
# See the CheckSpec.initialize function and if you want to add more see the initialize function
# head.

# = The CheckSpec class. It provides functionality to check wheather the XYAMLSpecification is ok or
# not. It is implemented in BDD style with tests/CheckSpec_spec.rb. ( spec tests/CheckSpec_spec.rb
# --format specdoc)
class CheckSpec

  # = The initialize function is the default and custom ctor which inits this class.
  # @param path Needs a string which describes the location (path) where the spec file is. (w/o trailing slash)
  # @param filename Needs a string which is the filename of the XYAML spec file. (w/o slashes)
  # @param libraries Add here the names of the require libraries you want to add. Spaces speparate the entries.
  def initialize path, filename, libraries = %w[yaml ostruct Extensions.rb]

    @file       = "#{path}/#{filename}"
    @libraries  = libraries

    # Some simple sanity testing
    self.exist?
    self.readable?

    # Load all libraries as defined in 'libraries'
    @libraries.each { |lib| loadLibrary! lib }

    # Load the XYAML Spec file and map it into a Ostruct
    @data = load!
    # @template = OpenStruct.new( data ).remap!

  end


  #### === Helper Methods

  # == Loads the XYAML Specification file
  def load! file = @file
    File.open( @file, "r" ) { |file| YAML.load( file ) }                 # return proc which is in this case a hash
  end


  # = Checks if the XYAML Spec file exists.
  def exist? file = @file
    raise ArgumentError, "XYAML Specification file not found." unless File.exist?( file )
  end

  # = Checks wheather the XYAML Spec file is readable or not.
  def readable? file = @file
    raise ArgumentError, "XYAML Specification file not readable." unless File.readable?( file )
  end

  # = Loads a given Library, e.g. 'yaml'
  # @warning Requires without check. This method needs repairing.
  def loadLibrary! name
    require "#{name.to_s}"

    # FIXME: Seems to be impossible to write this?
    # Search in the ObjectSpace if we already loaded name or NAME.
    #
    # unless( ObjectSpace.each_object( Module ).include?(name) or ObjectSpace.each_object( Module ).include?(name.upcase) ) 
    #   raise ArgumentError, "Can't load the #{name.to_s} library. Please install it, e.g. via gem." unless require "#{name.to_s}"
    # end
  end

  # = Checks wheather a given name is a existing section of the XYAML spec
  # @returns Boolean, true if it exists false if not.
  def section? name
    raise ArgumentError, "XYAML Specification does not contain the section ,#{name.to_s}'" if eval("@data.#{name.to_s}.nil?")
  end


  # = Checks wheather the XYAML Specification file contains only valid YAML.
  def valid? file = @file
      File.open( @file ) { |f| YAML::load( f ) }
  end


  #### === Meta Magic
