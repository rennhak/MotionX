- Goal:
    A interface to load a
      o Skeletal model
      o Sound file
      o Video file
      o Motion Capture file
      o Graphic depicting the motion capture marker points
      o Tons of metadata

    then store it in a intermedia format (YAML) but also be able to dump it to various other
    formats.
    
    Generally MotionX should be flexible to read all kinds of formats using a plugin interface, then
    convert the data to it's internal YAML format for various data processing and experimentation in
    e.g. Ruby. Finally then, it should let me convert the YAML data to a format of my choosing.
    The plugins should support reading and writing.

    Plugins should not only support standard formats but also allow direct interface to a Database.
    e.g. $mocap data + $misc data -(to yaml)-> MotionX -(to $db via plugin)-> $DB (Storage)
