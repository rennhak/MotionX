In this directory you can find the specification file which is used to generate the YAML interface
for this project. The specification file itself is a internal Ruby DSL which is used to generate a
Ruby interface. This should allow us to change the YAML specification if we ever need extend it.

Of course code generation is tricky and this might lead to trouble if you want to extend the
interface. Consult the README in the top directory or the TROUBLESHOOTING for further guides.


The Idea:
---------

We already work on YAML right? So we'll also use it to generate a interface. We could switch to
something build with S-Multi and things but that's maybe overkill. If you want to build a YAML
specfile that its probably more natural to use YAML for that too.


Remarks:
--------

I absolutely have to code something in the output file of the YAML gen. Hm, ok. Please overload the
methods in another file so that your changes don't get lost.


Specification File:
-------------------

This specicifation file has two purposes. Firstly, it contains the information for the YAML parser
of the structure, the naming and the description of the fields and values. This is used to
generate a Ruby interface for the MotionX format but could also be used to generate all kind of
other MotionX format interfaces in other languages using a simple YAML parser. Secondly, this
specification contains a lot of descriptive information which is extracted and presented in a
better human readable format.


To generate the Ruby specficiation Ruby Rake (a Make-like buildtool) is used:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  o rake checkspec      # => This will check the specification file for YAML syntax correctness and if it contains enough meta information.
  o rake genspec        # => This will backup old Ruby spec interface files and generate new ones.
  o rake tests          # => This will run RSpec tests to see if the generated code is ok or not. Do add tests here if you extended the XYAML spec.
  
  You should have have now a XYAML.rb file. The main file for the project cli/gui is
  MotionX.rb.

1         |- Think throughly which feature is missing and if it makes sense to add it 
2         \______
          | ..   |- Add the new structure to the XYAMLSpecification.yaml including good meta information.
          | ..   |- Run, "rake checkspec"
3         | ..   |____________________________________________
          | ..   |- Error, recheck                            | Works, run "rake genspec"
          | ..   |- In doubt "git revert.. "                  |------------------------------,
          | ..   \- ( Bad_Day? ) ? ( Goto 4 ) : ( Goto 3 )    |- Error, recheck              |- Yay, write tests be happy.
          | ..                                                \- Goto 4                      |- Commit and send me a message.

Hints:
------

  o Empty values get a "nil" value
  o Frame time in one file may NOT vary, this is used for an integrety check.
