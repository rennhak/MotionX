C3D to VPM and VPM to C3D Converter
-----------------------------------

The original source code of this project was a C++ based reader/writer of C3D to VPM and vice versa.
According to S. Kudoh the implementation support all platforms but is well known to work for intel
systems.

Original work flow: 

  o .c3d <-(read/write)-> vpm

New work flow:

  o .c3d <-(read/write)-> MotionX
  ( o .vpm <-(read/write)-> MotionX ) ----> is currently called "vpm plugin" and Ruby based.
                                            Q: Do we need a C++ version of this?

Requirements
------------

  o GCC
  o Boost
