In this directory you can find the specification file which is used to generate the YAML interface
for this project. The specification file itself is a internal Ruby DSL which is used to generate a
Ruby interface. This should allow us to change the YAML specification if we ever need extend it.

Of course code generation is tricky and this might lead to trouble if you want to extend the
interface. Consult the README in the top directory or the TROUBLESHOOTING for further guides.
