DataMapper + Migrations for MotionX
-----------------------------------

DataMapper (dm) is a excellent Ruby ORM which is similar to ActiveRecord et al. It allows a direct mapping
from the core ADT to a SQL based database backend. DataMapper supports all kind of abstractions thus
the capabilities of this plugins provide the following:


                                  /- SQLite Memory based
                                 |-- SQLite File based
                                 |-- MySQL
    MotionX ADT -(read/write)----|-- PgSQL
                                  \- JDBC


Furthermore, this package features the Migrations feature from Merb
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merb) for all changes to the DB. This will allow us to migrate the
Database between different Models of the ADT.


Evaluate:
  The MotionX ADT can change over time. So we use a YAML file for a abstraction table ?
