- Consider Skeleton
- Generate Template code for Yaml reader/writer so that we can easily add functions if necessary.
  (API stays the same only code gets generated)
  Build a nifty DSL for this. S-Multi ?
- Define a fixed API for the YAML interface.
- VRML
- Build Outputters for $formats but also for $database
- UML->YAML which tool is nice? ArgoUML? Dia? Hack on the Dia tree and include YAML/Ruby gen
- intltool
- xsltproc --novalid http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/manpages/docbook.xsl app.dbk >app.1
- YAML binary operator useful for "packages" ? http://yaml.org/type/binary.html
- Write BDD's for Extensions.rb

- Use "erb -x -T '-' templates/Ruby.erb | ruby -c" for Syntax check. Returns "Syntax OK"

- Generate from YAML? Poor man's UML? Can we leverage the power of RGen or some UML gen tool?
  HTML UML gen?

- Change the version number to sha1 key over XYAMLSpecification.yaml
  overkill?

- Generate YAML from UML
  YAML should be usable for C/C++/Ruby gen but also for ORM mapping

- YAML Classes? Seperate documents are classes? Or just Ruby .to_yaml?
  require 'yaml'
  C1 = Class.new
  puts C1.to_yaml #=> --- !ruby/object:Class {}
