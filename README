MotionX: Motion Capture Media Storage Format and Converter
----------------------------------------------------------

I called this package "Motion X" because there are too many formats out there.
This tool is intended to provide means to convert between those formats easily.

If you want to understand how this codebase works see documentation/Big_picture for details.


FAQ
---

Q: Why do you want to convert everything into YAML?
A: Did you read this webpage? http://yaml.org/ YAML has bindings in all kind of languages which
means that after we converted it into YAML you could actually read it with your $yaml parser in your
$language easily. You just look at the YAML specfication file of MotionX and can start coding right
away with your data.

Secondly, I wanted to have a nice internal data format. I work on Ruby and the OStruct hack with the
YAML parser makes it very convenient for me. [2]

Other choices would have been XML (no thanks, I already had that experience) or JSON (close call).
Probably I will build a JSON plugin to be able to dump that format on demand. Actually, JSON is
valid YAML except for the /* */ comments. [1]


Q: I want plugin X!
A: Patches are welcome, thanks for your help.
