Developers README
-----------------

The VPM Plugin works *hopefully* with all .vpm's out there but that probably depends on the types of 
capture devices used etc. So if you encounter a non-working version please drop me a note. (see
AINTAINERS file in the MotionX root directory).

  o The whole project has been realized fully in Ruby.
  o Testing is realized by rspec in a BDD manner


Structure
---------

The plugin uses a Abstract Data Type (ADT) internally because the MotionX ADT might change and I
just want to write different mappings if it should significantly change.

  VPM.rb          Commandline interface as well as library bindings
  ADT.rb          Ruby based ADT for internal use
  Mapping.rb      Converts the VPM.rb Object to the MotionX ADT
