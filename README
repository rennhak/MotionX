WHAT IS <TOPIC>?


ON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN?

    This Software was originally developed and tested on 32-bit x86 / SMP based PCs running on
    Debian GNU/Linux 2.6.x. Other direct Linux and Unix derivates should be viable too as
    long as all libary dependencys are met. All configurations are made from the associated config
    files. This software should also work on MS Windows based machines.


STRUCTURE

    From the outside ......... looks like a Merb Framework application but this is only partly true.
    This project utilizes the DataMapper ORM and RSpect as well as Migrations which have been
    already integrated with Merb nicely. For this project a "merb-gen very_flat" configuration was
    bootstrapped together with a standard configuration from "merb-gen app ; cp -vrap config ../".

    o Smart
        - Merb
            + Migrations
            + DataMapper ORM
        - RSpec
