# (c) 2009, Bjoern Rennhak, The University of Tokyo
# CheckSpec.rb reads the ../specification/XYAMLSpecification.yaml file and provides a CLI interface to
# either output the specific problem or only a binary switch if the spec is ok (TRUE, 1) or not ok
# (FALSE, 0).
#
# This tool is normally used by developers who extend the XYAMLSpecification.yaml file not by
# end-users.
