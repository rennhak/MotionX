ZIP Plugin - MotionX + LibZip
-----------------------------

This plugin can read and write zip packages. Zip packages are nothing else than just all data all
files, e.g. the YAML (w/o the binary data), Sound, Pictures, etc. bundled together as one file.
The point of this plugin is to

  - only one file for many sub-files generated from the MotionX ADT
  - provide means of offline storage for data extracted from the DB as .zip's
  - provide means of easier access than bundled .yaml's which contain base64 encoded payload
  - store data more efficiently (compression)
  - ...

Instead of having three, four or more separate files the .zip plugin just bundles everything.

e.g.

              /--- Sound
ZIP Package ------ Pictures
              \--- MotionX YAML
               \-- etc.


Usage
-----

  o Manual usage by commandline (why??!)
  o Automatic bundling by MotionX interface
