VPM Specification
-----------------

VPM is just concatinated segment data. This means the structure is as follows:
(Variables are indicated by a leading "$" sign).

Segment:        $NAME
Frames: $INTEGER
Frame Time:     $FLOAT
XTRAN   YTRAN   ZTRAN   XROT    YROT    ZROT    XSCALE  YSCALE  ZSCALE
INCHES  INCHES  INCHES  DEGREES DEGREES DEGREES PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT
$FLOAT $FLOAT $FLOAT $FLOAT $FLOAT $FLOAT $FLOAT $FLOAT 
....

Then it repeats. The segments are connected and not separeted.


Problems
---------

So far I have no reliable information on the exact specification of the .vpm files.
I heared by my supervisor that these files are generated by Vicon MoCap systems, but I have no way
to validate if a given VPM file is really valid or not. If you have any information about this
please drop me a eMail (see MAINTAINERS in the root) - thank you.
