# File: Specification.yaml
#
# YAML Specification file for the MotionX format.
# (c) 2009, Bjoern Rennhak, The University of Tokyo
#
# This specicifation file has two purposes. Firstly, it contains the information for the YAML parser
# of the structure, the naming and the description of the fields and values. This is used to
# generate a Ruby interface for the MotionX format but could also be used to generate all kind of
# other MotionX format interfaces in other languages using a simple YAML parser. Secondly, this
# specification contains a lot of descriptive information which is extracted and presented in a
# better human readable format.
#
# WARNING: This file MUST only contain valid YAML syntax.
#             o Don't use Ruby Keywords for the definition here. We call values like
#             metadata.motion.name etc. so it is a tad ambigious if you e.g. use a "type" field.
#
#             Not allowed:
#               o class
#               o type
#               o method
#
#             As you can see we gain convenience but lose exactness.
